# LANDING PAGE - CMS

- The landing page container will contain two container references:
  1) A header container that holds a maximum of ONE header module (REQUIRED).
  2) A rows container that can hold several types (MIN/MAX?) of row modules (REQUIRED).

- There are two high-level types of core 'row' modules for the rows container:
  1) A combination type, which can contain various combinations of smaller modules (e.g. small / medium / large) as defined further below.
