      h2 ORDERS

      h3 Iâ€™m in love with something that is out of stock in my size/in my favourite #{t('words.color')}. What can I do?
      p We can make to order! Simply make the purchase online and we will produce any item for you that is out of order. It will just take 7-10 business days for a made-to-order item as opposed to an item that is currently in stock.

      h3 Can I cancel my order?
      p If you would like to cancel your order, please email team@fameandpartners.com immediately with your cancellation request and order number.
      p If your dress is customised we cannot accept cancellations after 24 hours of purchasing.
      p If you wish to cancel your order outside of 24 hours, we can offer you a 50% refund and a 50% credit note or a full store credit note for future purchases with Fame & Partners.

      h3 How can I track my order?
      p As soon as your order ships, you will be provided with a tracking number via email. You can also find your order details and tracking information on the My Orders tab within the Account Settings section, which you can access when you are logged in. If you did not create a username/password or sign up when you purchased your dress, you will need to do so, to track your order.

      h2 Shipping & Deliveries

      h3 When will my order ship?
      
      p Shipping times vary depending on the complexity of any customisations you might order. All of our dresses are made on demand and making will commence the day your order is received. Our make time varies depending on customisations; between 4 - 8 business days which means you will receive your dress in up to 10 business days. We recommend allowing 2 weeks from the date of your purchase to ensure you have enough time for your dress to arrive for your special event. If you need a dress faster, simply contact our customer service team who can explain our express dress making service where you can receive your dress in 5 business days!

      p You can now select our express making option for an additional cost of $29. This option guarantees you that your dress will arrive with you within 2-5 business days. If you want to know the exact date for your dress to arrive, please contact our Customer Service via #{ mail_to('team@fameandpartners.com')}.
