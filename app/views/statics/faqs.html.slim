      h2 ORDERS

      h3 How can I track my order?
      h4 You can now track you order in My Account.
      p Login to your account and select the My Orders tab. Here you will be able to see if your dress has been shipped yet. The two statuses are not yet shipped or a tracking number. The tracking number will link through to our local courier service so you will be able to login to their portal and track where you order is.

      h3 Can I cancel my order?
      p
        ' If you would like to cancel your order, please
        => link_to 'Contact Us', new_contact_path
        ' immediately with your cancellation request and order number.
      p If your dress has been ordered with 'express making' we cannot accept cancellations as your dress goes immediately into production.
      p If your dress is customised we cannot accept cancellations after 24 hours from purchase. This is because your dress is already in production. If you wish to cancel your order outside of 24 hours, we can offer you a 50% refund and a 50% credit note with Fame & Partners. This is because the fabric has already been purchased and production started on your custom dress and in most cases we can not resell your dress at retail price.

      h2 Shipping & Deliveries
