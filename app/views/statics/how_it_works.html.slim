    h3 Best Fit Process
    p We are committed to helping you get the best possible fit for your dream dress.

    h3 30 Day Returns
    p If you are not happy with your dress, you may return it to us within 30 days of receipt for a full refund.

    h3 3 Week Turnaround
    p Our initial design process takes approximately 1 - 2 weeks. We then allow 2 - 3 weeks to produce your dress. Generally this averages out to a total of 3 - 4 weeks from the time you order until the time you receive your dress. We will always check to see when your formal event is to make sure we have plenty of time to get your dress right for you! We do require you to be responsive in order to achieve this turnaround time.

    h3 Additional Alterations
    p One of the reasons celebrities look great on the red carpet is because their dresses have been tailored to fit their exact measurements. As we fit to your nearest size block, as opposed to made-to-measure, we have established a relationship with Looksmart Alterations to provide you with the opportunity to make final alterations to your dress, should you feel it is required. Each dress comes with a $20 voucher for Looksmart.
