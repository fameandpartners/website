    h4 You can now track you order in My Account.
    p Login to your account and select the My Orders tab. Here you will be able to see if your dress has been shipped yet. The two statuses are not yet shipped or a tracking number. The tracking number will link through to our local courier service so you will be able to login to their portal and track where you order is.
