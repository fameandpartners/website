          p Fashion is so much more than how you look. It’s how you feel; it’s how you move; it’s how you tell the world, “This is who I am.”  Fashion should empower you from the inside out, so $5 of every sale now goes towards supporting women’s empowerment charities across the world.
          p Let’s empower each other, one dress at a time. Let’s dress up and give back.

          p Australian artist Dina Broadhurst creates feminine, sensual, sexual work that poses the question, “What is beautiful?” The answer almost always points to the chaotic beauty of a woman’s inner world and, for this reason, we knew Dina would be the ultimate partner for the INSIDE\OUT Collection. The results of ourcollaboration, a stunning mix of photography and collage, explore the idea that what’s happening on the inside is equally fascinating, beautiful, and inspiring as what we see on the outside.
