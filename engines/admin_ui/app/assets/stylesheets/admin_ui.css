 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the

 * TODO: Alexey Bobyrev 20/12/16 !!!!
 * We need to remove below included stylesheets from main app because this breaks engine's styleseet 
 * stack. And now we can break fame_admin by changes at redesign/product/_product_colours.
